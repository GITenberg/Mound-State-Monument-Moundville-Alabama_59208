foothills. On the banks of this
river many centuries ago there
flourished a great Indian metropolis.
Here dwelt a pleasant and
contented people whose story is not
of warring braves but of peaceful
artisans. Theirs were days not
of strife and treachery, but of
quiet toil and worship. These people,
given to pottery-making and
the building of fine temples, have
vanished long ago. The eloquence
of their handiwork endures. Their
pottery, lodged in the muddy earth,
emerges as fresh proof that &ldquo;a
thing of beauty is a joy forever&rdquo;.
Their temples, decayed these many
years, are yet in evidence, for
the pyramidal substructures of
these temples&mdash;earth mounds of
imposing size and number&mdash;remain.</p>
<p>The mounds and the story of
the people who built them, a story
recorded in clay and stone and
native metal, are preserved today
at Mound State Monument.</p>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">THE PREHISTORIC INHABITANTS OF MOUNDVILLE</span></h2>
<h3 id="c3"><span class="sc">Their physical appearance.</span></h3>
<p>The Indians dwelling in the ancient
city, though of medium stature,
were well built and muscular.
Their faces were finely molded and
handsome.</p>
<p>Considered stylish were &ldquo;flattened
heads&rdquo;. Head-flattening was
caused by strapping the young Indian
to a wooden cradle board.
The pressure of the leather thongs
on the soft bones of the baby&rsquo;s
head caused a flattening which
remained throughout life. Such a
head seems to have become a mark
of good rearing, and greatly to be
desired, for many mothers went
so far as to strap sand bags on
their children&rsquo;s heads to induce
this flattening.</p>

</div>
<h3 id="c4"><span class="sc">Their dress and ornamentation.</span></h3>
<p>Leather and fabrics woven
of vegetable fibres were fashioned
into garments. In extremely cold
weather robes made of feathers
may have been worn over the rest
of their clothing.</p>
<p>The Moundville Indians, both
men and women, were fond of personal
adornment. They wore ear
plugs, bracelets and arm bands
of copper, and beads and pendants
of bone, stone, shell and copper.
Many of their pendants, carved
with intricate and delicate designs,
would invoke the envy of women
of today. Long hairpins were
made of bone, and considerable
time was devoted to hairdressing.</p>

</div>
<h3 id="c5"><span class="sc">Their houses.</span></h3>
<p>From virgin
forests the Moundville Indians
gathered logs and poles to construct
frameworks for their homes.
Of reeds and canes gathered along
the river they wove house walls,
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
plastering them with thick coatings
of moistened sand and clay.
Thatched roofs were made of heavy
swamp grass. A hole was left in
the center to serve as a chimney.
The floors were of hard-packed
clay frequently covered with sand.
These structures were neat, comfortable
and weatherproof.</p>

</div>
<h3 id="c6"><span class="sc">Their food.</span></h3>
<p>Living in a temperate
climate amid forests teeming
with wild game and streams
abundant with fish, the Moundville
Indians had little difficulty,
experienced few uncertainties, in
obtaining their food. In addition
to meat and fish obtained from
forest and stream there were vegetables
from fertile fields which
produced with little man-made effort
an ample supply of maize,
squash, beans and pumpkins.</p>
<h3 id="c7"><span class="sc">Their implements.</span></h3>
<p>A community
of skilled artisans, these
people fashioned many tools for
food-getting, shelter-making and
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
clothing-manufacture as well as
for more aesthetic pursuits. With
nets woven of vegetable fibre and
barbless fishhooks of bone and
copper they took fish from nearby
streams and lakes. With small,
skillfully chipped arrowheads they
brought down fowl. Ingenious
traps ensnared large game. Stone
fleshers were used for stripping
the meat and dressing the leather.
With bone awls and needles sharpened
on grinding stones they sewed
leather garments. Stone mortars
and pestles pulverized their grain.
Stone chisels and axes felled, with
the aid of fire, trees for their
homes and temples. Cups and
forks and spoons carved from shell
were their cooking and eating utensils.</p>

<p class="pcap">A MEMENTO OF ABORIGINAL RELIGIOUS CEREMONIES AT MOUNDVILLE.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="c8"><span class="sc">Their religion.</span></h3>
<p>Of paramount
importance to the Moundville
Indian was his religion. The
mounds, on which he worshiped,
are enduring monuments to the
strength and fervor of his faith.
Tons and tons of clay, loam and
sand he carried to form these
towering structures. Atop the
earth pyramids he built great
wooden temples and special dwelling
houses for chieftans and
priests.</p>
<p>Ceremonies performed in the
temples were elaborate and colorful.
Priests attired in symbolic
costumes, and bearing numerous
esoteric accoutrements, directed
the rituals. Ceremonial trappings
included beautiful copper breast
plates, shell gorgets, and stone
discs and pendants, all delicately
carved with intricate, allegorical
designs. Among these designs
were depictions of the skull and
arm-bone, the hand and all-seeing
eye, entwined rattlesnakes, and the
horned or plumed serpent. Similar
designs are found in the symbolic
art of the Indians of Central
America and Mexico, the Mayas
and Aztecs.</p>

<p class="pcap">PIPES WHICH THE MOUNDVILLE INDIANS MOLDED FROM CLAY.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="c9"><span class="sc">Other activities.</span></h3>
<p>Games and
contests were popular among the
Moundville Indians. One favorite
game had the combined features
of our football and baseball.
Another was similar to a combination
of bowling and shuffleboard.</p>
<p>Tobacco-smoking was practiced
not as a habit but as a ceremony.
Beautiful pipes&mdash;some carved from
stone, others molded from clay&mdash;were
smoked through a long cane
stem, the bowl resting on the
ground. Some pipes were shaped
to resemble the human body.
Others were carved or molded in
the shape of birds, animals and
insects.</p>
<h3 id="c10"><span class="sc">Their burial customs.</span></h3>
<p>The
dead were buried with care and
respect. Belief in immortality was
expressed by placing material
goods near the deceased to sustain
him in the other world. His treasured
belongings, usually pottery
vessels, beads, bracelets and other
ornaments, were buried with him.</p>
<p>The Moundville Indian built no
burial mounds. His dead were
buried in cemetery areas within
the city. Usually burial was made
in a pit large enough to accommodate
the body at full length.
Sometimes, however, burial was
made in a small pit, the body being
drawn up in a flexed position.
Burial of the skeleton after it had
been stripped of flesh was sometimes
practiced.</p>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">MOUNDVILLE POTTERY</span></h2>
<p>The very nature of the Moundville
Indian&rsquo;s surroundings provided
security and leisure. His
time was not consumed in constant
search for food and warmth,
and to squander his time, grow
fat and lazy, was not in him. His
skill and versatility required expression,
which he found in the
art of pottery-making.</p>

<p class="pcap">POTTERY BEAKER WITH A SYMBOLIC DESIGN.</p>
<p class="pcapc">
After the beaker was removed from the ground by the archaeologist the incised
lines were filled with white paint in order to emphasize the design.</p>
</div>
<p>He manufactured great quantities
of pottery for domestic use.
Moistening clay which he took
from the river bank, he kneaded
into it particles of crushed shell.
This was to keep the molded clay
from cracking when it hardened.
He shaped the clay into jars, pots,
bowls and other utilitarian objects,
hardening them with fire.
This domestic ware was plain,
bearing no decoration.</p>
<p>It was through non-utilitarian
ware, exquisitely decorated, that
the Moundville Indian wrought
careful and lasting expression of
his artistry. The potter used only
his finest clay for this ware. After
forming the clay into some delicately
molded vessel, then hardening
it with fire, he dipped the
vessel into a black &ldquo;wash&rdquo; which
coated it with a smooth, black
film. The coloring agent contained
in this &ldquo;wash&rdquo; was derived, indirectly,
from plants.</p>
<p>Usually the potter decorated the
vessel with some intricate design,
often incising the lines on the vessel
before it was hardened, at other
times scratching them on the hardened
vessel. Sometimes the etched
or incised lines of the design were
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
filled with red paint, derived from
iron ore, which gave the design a
striking appearance on the polished
black surface of the vessel.</p>
<p>Water bottles, bowls, pots, shallow
dishes, and effigy vessels were
made of this thin, black ware.
Their forms included frog, duck,
beaver, rabbit, eagle, bat, owl, fish,
shell and even human shapes.</p>
<p>Designs incised or engraved on
this ware depicted the plumed or
horned serpent, the ivory-billed
woodpecker, eagle, sun, human
hand and eye, skull and armbones,
and numerous others.</p>
<p>Sometimes vessels were decorated
with red and white paint
(derived from iron and lead ore)
instead of being &ldquo;washed&rdquo; black.
This type of decoration was not
common, however.</p>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">WHAT TO SEE AT MOUND STATE MONUMENT</span></h2>
<h3 class="center">The Mounds</h3>
<p>The present-day visitor to Mound
State Monument may see, on the
300-acre Monument tract, 40
mounds which are the remnants of
the Moundville Indians&rsquo; great city.</p>
<p>The visitor will be interested in
identifying these mounds as <i>domiciliary</i>
(as distinguished from
burial mounds and effigy mounds
found at other Indian sites). These
domiciliary mounds, which were
erected as substructures for temples
and other important buildings,
are rectangular truncated-pyramids.
Their sizes vary. The largest,
called Mound &ldquo;B&rdquo; (see <a href="#Page_18">map</a>),
is 58&frac12; feet high and covers almost
two acres.</p>
<h3 class="center">Prehistoric Lakes</h3>
<p>The several lakes within the
Monument area are restorations,
made after considerable research,
of prehistoric reservoirs. The
forty- to sixty-foot bluff at the
ancient city&rsquo;s river front made
the Warrior River an impractical
source of water supply. These
lakes, therefore, may have been
used to catch and hold water for
daily use and for fishing.</p>
<h3 class="center">ERSKINE RAMSAY ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH CENTER</h3>
<p>Already constructed through the
generosity of Dr. Erskine Ramsay,
Birmingham, Alabama, Honorary
Chairman of the Board of Regents
of the Museum, is a large and spacious
laboratory building, in which
all archaeological material comprising
the Museum&rsquo;s vast collection
is suitably and adequately
housed. Space is available for
students to study any phase of the
subject in which they may be interested.
(See photograph on <a href="#Page_20">page 20</a>.)</p>
<p>Also completed in the Research
Center is one cottage in which a
married student might be housed
during the period of his studies.</p>
<p>Yet to be constructed are two
cottages, a dormitory for unmarried
students, and a house for the
resident archaeologist.</p>

<h3 class="center">The Archaeological Museum</h3>
<h3 class="center"><span class="sc">Arrangement.</span></h3>
<p>The archaeological
museum houses an exhibit
hall and two <i>in situ</i> burial groups.
The exhibit hall makes up the main
part of the building. The in situ
burial groups are enclosed in wings
at the north and south ends of the
exhibit hall.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Design.</span></h3>
<p>Design of the building
itself was based on ideas used by
the Moundville Indian in shaping
and decorating his artifacts. The
classic three-step motif expressed
in the three roof levels of the
museum, and used over the doorway,
was a favorite design element
of the Moundville artist. The
skull and arm-bone design making
up the parapet frieze was copied
from a design on a Moundville Indian
pot (<i>see photograph on p.</i> <a href="#Page_11">11</a>).
The medallion over the entrance is
an enlarged reproduction of a
stone pendant once owned by a
Moundville Indian (<i>see photograph
on p.</i> <a href="#Page_4">4</a>). This pendant as well as
the pot from which the frieze was
copied may be seen in the exhibit
hall.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Main exhibit hall.</span></h3>
<p>Displays
in the exhibit hall are designed to
illustrate (1) a brief history of
prehistoric man, (2) cultural traits
and physical characteristics of the
prehistoric Moundvillian, and (3)
physical features of Mound State
Monument.</p>
<p>A brief story of prehistoric mankind
is given in the three wall
cases to the visitor&rsquo;s left as he
enters the museum. Cultural traits
of the Moundville Indian are illustrated
in the eight cases along the
back wall, and in the five table
cases in the exhibit hall. Physical
features of Mound State Monument
are depicted in the three
wall cases to the visitor&rsquo;s left as
he leaves the museum.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Burial groups.</span></h3>
<p>The north wing
of the museum (to the Visitor&rsquo;s left
as he enters the building) encloses
seventeen <i>in situ</i> burials. The
south wing (to the visitor&rsquo;s left
as he leaves the building) encloses
forty such burials. These fifty-seven
burials, together with their
accompanying pottery, ornaments
and other artifacts, have been uncovered
and left in the ground
exactly as they were found.</p>
<p>These burials had been placed
in a cemetery area, not a mound.
Most of the burials were approximately
one and one-half feet under
the surface of the ground,
although some were only four
inches underground and others
were three feet. The original
ground-level is demonstrated in the
exhibit by lines drawn around the
edges of the pits.</p>
<p>Studies of Moundville skeletal
remains have revealed the sex and
individual age (<i>i.e.</i>, how old the individual
was at the time of
burial) of each burial, as well as
certain physical defects. Effects
of head-flattening, a practice described
elsewhere on these pages,
are apparent on many of the
skulls.</p>

Archaeological material,
including skeletons from the Museum&rsquo;s
extensive excavations in
the Tennessee Valley Region in
Alabama, its earlier work in Eastern
Arkansas, surface collections
from all over Alabama and from
scattered excavations in many
parts of the state, has been assembled
in especially designed storage
racks in the main part of the
building. Our plan is to have all
of the Museum&rsquo;s archaeological
material, photographs, field notes,
and library at this central point,
where any part of it may be studied
and comparisons made with other
parts. Archaeologists are invited
to avail themselves of the opportunity
thus afforded.</p>
<p>Artifacts of clay, bone, shell,
copper, flint, and stone are packed
in pasteboard cartons which are
numbered according to site and
type of material. Skeletal material
is packed in butter tubs and pasteboard
cartons. All bones have
been carefully cleaned, soaked in
permanent hardener, and catalogued.
All records of excavations,
surveys, profiles, field notes, topographic
sheets, index catalogues, et
cetera are also housed in the building.</p>
<p>We are proud to have such a fine
lot of material available in one
building.</p>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="small">PICNIC BUILDING</span></h2>
<p>This building, on a high bluff
overlooking the Warrior River,
was covered in the original master
plan for the area. It was made
possible through a large donation
by two friends of the Museum who
wish that their identity be withheld.</p>
<p>The central section of the building
is equipped with banquet type
tables and folding chairs, having
a seating capacity of about 200.
In the west wing is a fully equipped
kitchen and large barbecue pit. In
the east wing are rest rooms, with
outside entrances.</p>
<p>Around the building is a large
concrete terrace which is equipped
with portable tables and built-on
seats, each with a capacity of eight
people. The terrace will accommodate
about 300 people.</p>
<p>Through special arrangement
with the Director, the Curator, or
the Park Manager, the building
may be reserved for picnic groups
having their own lunches, or for
parties wishing to use kitchen facilities.</p>
<p>Charges for school groups with
their own lunches: 10c each; for
other parties having their own
food: $5.00 minimum, or 10c each,
whichever amount is the larger;
with somewhat more being charged
for use of kitchen facilities, depending

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
